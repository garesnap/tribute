                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item bg-dark"><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
